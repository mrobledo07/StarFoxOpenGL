## 🎮 Game Features

- 3D space environment rendered with OpenGL
- Responsive touch controls for navigation and shooting
- No collision detection, only obstacles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **OpenGL ES** for 3D rendering
- **Android Studio** as the development environment
- **Java** for Android application logic 
- Custom game loop and rendering pipeline

## 👨‍💻 Developer

- Miguel Robledo Kusz

## 📚 Academic Context

This project was developed as a university practice of the **Modeling and Visualization** subject in Universitat Rovira i Virgili applying low-level OpenGL techniques in a real-time, interactive setting.
